  <h3>Adelphi Hotel</h3>
    <p>Jan. 2017 - Jun.2017 / Melbourne, Australia </p>
  <h4>Night Manager</h4>
    <p>The Adelphi Hotel offered me the opportunity to gain working experience in the exciting environment in Melbourne’s most prestigious boutique property. During this brief assignment I put my focus on transferring my knowledge about operational and administrative procedures into the front office team and to learn about their unique guest experience concepts. Furthermore I gained insights into the Revenue Management and yielding strategies of the Adelphi. Additionally I develop and establish a Menu Engineering concept for the F&B department in order to increase profitability.</p>

  <h3>Kempinski Hotel Airport Munich</h3>
    <p>Feb. 2011 - May 2014 / Munich, Germany</p>
  <h4>Front Office Supervisor</h4>
    <p>With my promotion to Front Office Supervisor I enhanced my organizational, communicational and time management skills as well as my ability to work under high pressure. These qualities had been proven by unpredicted demand changes (such as layover coordination), VIP handling and complaint management as well as the supervision of up to ten team members at the FO and its sub departments. The supervision included all shifts, staff trainings, quality control, coordination of operational tasks and the responsible, cost efficient use of working material and labor force.
    In addition to my daily duties I developed and supervised the hotels upselling program and a Front Office KPI rally. The success of these programs was shown by increased KPI figures as well as in customer and employee satisfaction. The upselling program itself yielded 130k of additional room revenues annually.</p>
